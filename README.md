# stealify-socketcluster
A SocketCluster (npm) Implamentation based on graaljs using stealify concepts has integrated: Apache Ignite,  Zookeeper

Long years ago i spotted a Project called SocketCluster i was in love with it as i was a mid level JS coder they where working on stuff that i also did often (distributed messaging via websockets).

They had a homepage with a nice documentation about the concepts and ideas behind the framework while the framework it self was not so well out of my view the concepts and toughts putted in was well.

Today as we got Stealify i want to hornor that project and supply a Solid Production Ready Version of it as building block for distributed messaging Applications based on many channels.

The original Components are worker with a borker, optional redis, and a single state instance.

As we need only to reuse the frontend facing parts and the backend related needs mapping.
